## Objective

The objective of this workshop is to write a console-based shopping cart with
Java. The shopping cart will be stored with an appropriate collection type.

## Setup

a. Create an account on Github.com. You can ignore this step if you have an
account.

b. Create a repository on Github

c. Open your IDE and create the directories called src and classes; these
directories are for your source code and compiled Java classes respectively

d. Make the project directory a Git repository

e. Add `.gitignore` to ignore the target directory

f. Add the remote repository (step b above) as the origin of your local
repository

## Workshop
Write a Java console program that allows a user to add, remove and list the
contents of a shopping card.
The behaviour of the program is shown below. The > is the prompt
```
Welcome to your shopping cart
> list
Your cart is empty
> add apple
apple added to cart
> add orange, pear
orange added to cart
pear added to cart
> list
1. apple
2. orange
3. pear
delete 2
orange removed from cart
> list
1. apple
2. pear
> add apple, grapes
You have apple in your cart
grapes added to cart
> list
1. apple
2. pear
3. grapes
> delete 4
Incorrect item index
```

You are to implement the following commands
- `list` - list the contents of the cart. If the cart is empty, print an
appropriate message. The contents of the cart should be numbered when
you are listing them
- `add` - add one or more items to the cart. Multiple items are separated by a
comma (,).
You should not add an item that is already in the cart. Print an appropriate
message.
Item names are case sensitive (or you can try implementing case
insensitive)
- `delete` - delete an item from the cart based on the item’s index (from
list command). If an incorrect index is provided, display an error message

## Submission
When you have completed your program, commit and push your code to the
remote repository.
